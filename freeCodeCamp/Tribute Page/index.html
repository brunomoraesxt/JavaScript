        <p>H.G. Tannhaus is a clockmaker who operates a shop in Winden, and the grandfather of Charlotte Doppler. 
        He is the author of A Journey Through Time, a book which discusses black holes, spacetime, and similar subjects, 
        and has appeared in educational videos teaching about the same.</p>

        <p>He provides many voiceovers, and is first seen on TV in the bunker in "Lies." 
        He is not established as resident in Winden, however, until the Stranger visits his shop in "Past and Present." 
        The Stranger returns several times over the next few days to discuss time travel, determinism, the 33-year cycle, 
        and related matters. It is later revealed that these conversations took place in 1986, 
        that Charlotte is not his biological granddaughter, and that the Stranger had come to visit to have Tannhaus repair his damaged apparatus. 
        Tannhaus admits as well that he does not fully understand all the concepts in his own book, and is only a pawn in a larger war.</p>
